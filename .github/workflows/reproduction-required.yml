                      Hello! We appreciate you bringing this issue to our attention.

                      To assist our collaborators or contributors in identifying and resolving the problem,
                      it would be helpful if you could provide a minimal reproduction of the issue.

                      We recommend using our React Native template,
                      which can be found at https://github.com/wix-incubator/detoxtemplate,
                      but any minimal reproduction project would be appreciated.

                      Your help is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your support!
