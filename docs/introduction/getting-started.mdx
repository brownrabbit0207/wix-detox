# Environment Setup

**Welcome to Detox!**

The _Introduction section_ walks you through setting up Detox in your project, one step at a time.

You will find that some steps are longer than the others: some are a couple of paragraphs, while the others look like a dedicated multistep guide.
Bear with us - it is all necessary, and once set up, it is easy to move forward with writing tests at a high pace.

Please select type of your mobile application before you start the tutorial:

<Tabs groupId="appType">
    <TabItem value="start-rn" label="React Native" default>
        <IntroRN />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="start-expo" label="Expo">
        <IntroExpo />
    </TabItem>

To complete the environment setup, you still have 2 steps ahead: installing `detox-cli` and `applesimutils`.

### 1. Command Line Tools (`detox-cli`)

`detox-cli` is merely a script that passes commands through to
a local Detox executable located at `node_modules/.bin/detox`,
making it easier to operate Detox from the command line, e.g. `detox test -c ios.sim.debug`.

It should be installed globally, enabling usage of the command line tools outside your npm scripts:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install detox-cli --global
```

On the other hand, if you are fine with running Detox commands with `npx detox ...`, you may skip installing `detox-cli`.

### 2. [MacOS Only] `applesimutils`

This tool is **required** by Detox to work with iOS simulators. The recommended way to install
[`applesimutils`](https://github.com/wix/AppleSimulatorUtils) is via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew tap wix/brew
brew install applesimutils
```

:::info Note

Make sure to periodically update your version of `applesimutils` to the latest version.

Now, when your environment is ready, let's move to the next section, [Project Setup](project-setup.mdx).
