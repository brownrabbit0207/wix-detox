To check if a specific device type (e.g. `iPhone 12`) is installed locally, run:

```bash
xcrun simctl list devicetypes
```

If it is available, you'll see it among the other device types in the output:

```plain text
== Device Types ==
iPhone 4s (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-4s)
iPhone 5 (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-5)
â€¦
iPhone SE (2nd generation) (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-SE--2nd-generation-)
iPhone 12 mini (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-12-mini)
```

:::tip

If the device type list is empty or you need a specific iOS version,
go to `Xcode > Preferences > Components` and install a proper Simulator version from the list:
