Create a `package.json` in your project's root by running this command:

```bash
npm init -y
```
```

The next step is to **install a test runner**. Out of the box, Detox offers you a first-class integration
with [Jest](https://jestjs.io), a popular and proven choice in the JavaScript community:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install jest --save-dev
```

If you are not familiar with Jest, we recommend you to read the [Jest: Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started) guide.
