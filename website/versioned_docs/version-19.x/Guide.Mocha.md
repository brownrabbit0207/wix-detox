## Mocha Setup Guide

This guide describes how to install [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) as a test runner to be used by Detox for running the E2E tests.

Note that while Mocha is lightweight and easy to set up, we nevertheless encourage usage of [Jest](Guide.Jest.md) instead, for 2 main reasons:

1. Mocha does not support parallel-test execution (i.e. splitting the test suites between concurrently running test devices/emulators).
1. Advanced integration features such as taking device screenshots on failures will not be as timely accurate as with working with Jest.

### Installation

**Disclaimer:** Here we focus on installing Detox on _new projects_. If youâ€™re migrating a project with an existing Detox installation, please apply some common sense while using this guide.

#### 1. Install Mocha

Before starting with Mocha setup, be sure to complete the preliminary sections of the [Getting Started](introduction/getting-started.md) guide.

```bash npm2yarn
