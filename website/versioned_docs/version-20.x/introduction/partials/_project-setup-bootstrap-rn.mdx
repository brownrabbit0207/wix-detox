Out of the box, Detox offers you a first-class integration with [Jest](https://jestjs.io), the most popular testing framework for React Native. That's why your first step will be to install or update Jest in your project.

Go to your project's root folder, i.e., where `package.json` is found, and run:

```bash npm2yarn

:::

Now it's time to install Detox itself:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install detox --save-dev
```
